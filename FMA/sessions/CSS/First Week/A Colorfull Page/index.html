            <h2>Tennis</h2>
            <p>Tennis is a dynamic and widely popular sport that combines physical skill, strategy, and mental
                toughness. Played either individually (singles) or in teams of two (doubles), it takes place on a
                rectangular court divided by a net, with players using rackets to hit a felt-covered rubber ball over
                the net and into the opponent's court. The main goal is to score points by hitting the ball in a way
                that makes it difficult or impossible for the opponent to return it within the court's boundaries.
                Tennis matches are structured into sets, with players aiming to win six games per set, and typically
                requiring two or three sets to win a match. The game can be played on different surfaces, including
                grass, clay, and hard courts, each influencing ball speed, bounce, and playing styles. For instance,
                grass courts are fast and favor aggressive play, while clay courts slow down the ball, favoring baseline
                rallies and endurance. Tennis also demands strong physical attributes like agility, speed, stamina, and
                hand-eye coordination, along with mental resilience to handle high-pressure situations. Globally
                celebrated tournaments like the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open make up the
                prestigious Grand Slam, drawing millions of fans and showcasing the sport's top talent. Beyond
                professional play, tennis is also a popular recreational activity, promoting fitness, strategic
                thinking, and social interaction.</p>

            <h2>PingPong</h2>
            <p>Ping pong, also known as table tennis, is a fast-paced and skillful sport played on a rectangular table
                divided by a net. Originating in the late 19th century as an indoor alternative to lawn tennis, it has
                grown into a globally popular game, both recreationally and competitively. The game is played either
                one-on-one (singles) or in pairs (doubles), with players using lightweight paddles to hit a small
                plastic ball back and forth across the table. The goal is to score points by striking the ball so that
                it bounces once on the opponentâ€™s side and prevents them from making a legal return. Known for its quick
                reflexes and rapid exchanges, ping pong requires sharp hand-eye coordination, agility, and strategic
                thinking. The ball can reach incredible speeds, especially during professional rallies, making spin
                techniques like topspin, backspin, and sidespin crucial elements of advanced gameplay. Matches are
                typically played in a best-of-five or best-of-seven format, with players aiming to reach 11 points per
                game while maintaining at least a two-point lead. Recognized as an Olympic sport since 1988, table
                tennis has a strong global following, particularly in countries like China, where it is considered a
                national sport. Beyond competitive play, ping pong is enjoyed worldwide as a fun and accessible game
                that promotes quick thinking, coordination, and friendly competition.</p>

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>Basketball is a fast-paced and dynamic team sport that emphasizes skill, strategy, and athleticism.
                Invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, it has grown into one of the most popular sports worldwide,
                played at both recreational and professional levels. The game is played between two teams of five
                players on a rectangular court, with the primary objective of scoring points by shooting a ball through
                the opposing team's hoop, which is mounted 10 feet above the ground. Each basket is typically worth two
                points, with shots made from beyond the three-point line earning three points, and free throws awarded
                one point each. Basketball requires a combination of physical abilities, such as speed, agility,
                strength, and endurance, along with technical skills like dribbling, passing, shooting, and rebounding.
                Teamwork and strategy play a significant role, with players taking on specific roles like guards,
                forwards, and centers, each contributing to offense and defense. The game is played in four quarters,
                with the team scoring the most points by the end declared the winner. Professional leagues, such as the
                NBA (National Basketball Association), have elevated basketball's global appeal, showcasing legendary
                players and intense competition. Additionally, events like the Olympic Games and FIBA World Cup further
                highlight the sport's international reach. Beyond the professional stage, basketball remains a beloved
                pastime in schools, parks, and communities, fostering teamwork, discipline, and a passion for the game.
