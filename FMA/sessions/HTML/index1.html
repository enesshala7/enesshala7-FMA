            <h2>Cows</h2>
            <p>
                <strong><i>Cows</i></strong> are large, domesticated mammals commonly raised for their milk, meat, and
                hides. They belong to the
                species Bos taurus and are found all over the world in various breeds suited for different climates and
                purposes. As herbivores, cows primarily feed on grass, hay, and grains, using their specialized stomachs
                to digest plant material efficiently. They play a crucial role in agriculture, providing dairy products
                like milk, cheese, and butter, as well as beef for consumption. Additionally, cows have cultural and
                economic significance in many societies, often symbolizing prosperity and sustenance.

            <h2>Horses</h2>
            <p>Horses (*Equus ferus caballus*) are majestic and powerful mammals that have been domesticated for
                thousands of years, playing a vital role in human civilization. Known for their speed, endurance, and
                intelligence, they have been used for transportation, warfare, agriculture, and sports across different
                cultures. Horses come in a wide variety of breeds, each adapted for specific purposes—some are built for
                strength and hard labor, like draft horses, while others, such as Thoroughbreds and Arabians, excel in
                racing and endurance riding.

                As herbivores, horses primarily graze on grass and hay, and their unique digestive system allows them to
                process fibrous plant material efficiently. Unlike ruminants such as cows, horses have a
                single-chambered stomach but rely on a specialized fermentation process in their hindgut to break down
                cellulose. Their strong legs and well-developed muscles enable them to run at high speeds, with some
                breeds reaching up to 55 mph (88 km/h) in short bursts.

                Horses are highly social animals that form strong bonds within their herds, communicating through body
                language, vocalizations, and subtle facial expressions. They are also known for their deep connections
                with humans, responding to training and commands with remarkable sensitivity. Throughout history, they
                have symbolized strength, freedom, and nobility, leaving an enduring mark on human culture. Today,
                horses are still widely used in sports such as show jumping, dressage, rodeo, and racing, as well as for
                therapy and recreational riding. Whether in competitive events, working on farms, or simply as beloved
                companions, horses continue to be one of humanity’s most valued and respected animals.</p>

            <h2>Mule</h2>
            <p>Mules, the hybrid offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare), are remarkable animals
                known for their strength, endurance, and intelligence. They inherit a unique combination of traits from
                both parents, blending the horse’s speed and agility with the donkey’s resilience and surefootedness.
                This makes mules incredibly versatile, often outperforming both horses and donkeys in terms of workload
                and efficiency. Throughout history, they have been used for transportation, agriculture, and military
                purposes, valued for their ability to carry heavy loads over rough terrain with minimal need for rest or
                excessive food. Unlike horses, mules have a strong natural resistance to disease, can withstand harsh
                climates, and possess tougher hooves, reducing their risk of injury in rugged environments.

                One of the most distinctive features of mules is their sterility, a result of having 63 chromosomes—an
                uneven number that prevents successful reproduction. While rare cases of fertile mules exist, they are
                exceptions rather than the rule. Despite this, mules continue to be bred for their hardworking nature,
                making them an essential asset in regions where reliable working animals are needed. Their temperament
                is also unique; they are known for their intelligence and cautious nature, often avoiding dangerous
                situations that a horse might rush into. This trait has led to the saying, “Mules are too smart to get
                hurt,” as they instinctively assess risks before acting.

                Mules come in various sizes, depending on the breed of horse used in breeding. Small mules are often
                used for farm work or as pack animals, while larger mules can be trained for riding, logging, and even
                competitive events. Their versatility extends to modern times, where they are still commonly used in
                mountainous regions, national parks, and developing countries for their unmatched ability to navigate
                difficult landscapes. With their reputation for being hardworking, long-lived, and low-maintenance,
                mules remain an invaluable part of many cultures and industries worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Unicorn</h2>
            <p>Unicorns are mythical creatures often depicted as elegant, horse-like beings with a single spiraled horn
                on their foreheads. Legends of unicorns date back thousands of years, appearing in ancient texts from
                civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Greece, and China. While their appearance varies across cultures,
                they are commonly associated with purity, grace, and magical abilities. In medieval Europe, unicorns
                were believed to be rare, untamable creatures, often linked to divine power. Their horns, known as
                alicorns, were said to have healing properties, capable of purifying water and curing diseases. Because
                of these legendary traits, unicorn horns were highly sought after, and some believed that only the pure
                of heart could tame or even approach a unicorn.</p>
